# ros2-project-builder
This project streamlines the creation and configuration of ROS 2 nodes by automating the setup of node structures, including publishers, subscribers, services, and parameters. Itâ€™s designed to reduce boilerplate and accelerate ROS 2 development by generating consistent and ready-to-use components with minimal manual effort.
